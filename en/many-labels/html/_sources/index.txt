Labels for Debian CDs and DVDs
==============================

There are so many CDs of Debian, it takes a frustratingly long time to
create their
labels!!!!!!!!

I named my makefile script "many-labels" in gratitude and
sardonically. Before cursing Debian CD Group, let's try this
script. Have a coffee break, take a deep breath, and relax.


Installation
------------

Please prepare debian installed computer.
::

   su -
   (sudo -H -s as Ubuntu user)
   aptitude install bzr make inkscape
   exit
   bzr branch lp:many-labels

If you already download it, execute the following.
::

   cd many-labels
   bzr pull lp:many-labels


Preparation
-----------

Create your own SVG file named as "many-labels/image-factory/debian.svg",
add these strings to "debian.svg" and comment out them:
::

   <!--VERSION-->
   <!--CODENAME-->
   <!--ARCHITECTURE-->
   <!--MEDIA-->
   <!--MEDIA_NUM-->

They will be replaced as follows:
::

   9.0.0
   Stretch
   amd64
   DVD
   Disc 14


Usage
-----

Please choose from the following options:
::

   cd many-labels/
   make
   make all
   make translations
   make translations VERSION=9.0.0 CODE_NAME=Stretch UBUNTU_VERSION_NUM=17.04
   (If you want to create ubuntu labels for Japanese remix)
   make translations LNG=ja
   (If you want to create tarball)
   make create-tarball
   (If you want to remove labels)
   make clean

If you want to create labels for every architecture, edit Makefile like this:
::

   ARCHS := $(shell sed -e "/^\#/d" ./ARCHS)
   # ARCHS = amd64 i386 end


LightScribe Labeler
-------------------

`LACIE <http://www.lacie.com/>`_

Install LightScribe Host Software at first!!!
Next, install LaCie LightScribe Labeler.
::

   su -
   aptitude install alien
   mv LaCie\ LightScribe\ Labeler\ version\ Linux.rpm \
   LaCie-LightScribe-Labeler-version-Linux.rpm
   alien LaCie-LightScribe-Labeler-version-Linux.rpm
   dpkg --install LaCie-LightScribe-Labeler-version-Linux.deb
