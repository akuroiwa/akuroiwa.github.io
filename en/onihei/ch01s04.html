<p>
	There are many large staffing agencies that have voluntary contracts with governments and local governments. The Board of Audit should audit them directly instead of leaving it to the local governments. Subsidies for local employment are being misused to enrich the temp agencies. To make matters worse, temp agencies are trying to get into the training program to hire the ice age generation. All they want to do is to abuse the policy and line their own pockets. This will only enrich those who have destroyed the lives of the ice age generation and forced them to work for low wages hard to earn a decent living.
      </p>
<p>
	Temp agencies also provide job information services and
	recruit temporary staff and teachers for local
	governments. Why can't they be hired as full-time employees
	rather than paying commissions to them?  The temp agencies try
	to benefit from the government's employment policies by
	setting up various affiliates.  We must not let them do what
	they want.
