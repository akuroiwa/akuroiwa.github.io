	With Lockin, companies grow and accumulate money and
	technology.  Eventually, they began to use their financial
	power to buy out companies.  This prevents new entrants from
	entering the market, resulting in price competition, and
	eventually technological development stagnates.  With the rise
	of the Internet, the fledgling U.S.  company turned its
	attention to the software industry, where development funds
	were cheaper, and grew into a global company.  An inexpensive
	development infrastructure is important when starting a
	business.  The idea of open source is not limited to software;
	it is also widespread in the manufacturing industry.  It
	' s open architecture and open innovation.

	Genetic modification used to cost a lot of money and
	equipment, but now some people do it as a hobby.  Open source
	software and documentation are co-developed on GitHub and
	other sites.  CAD data is available on the Internet, and with
	the spread of 3D printers, anyone can enter the manufacturing
	industry. It is an era when semiconductor circuits can be
	designed by programming. You can participate in
	pharmaceuticals and drug repositioning with Cheminformatics.
	People from all over the world are collaborating, exposing and
	showcasing their skills, wisdom and art.

	The BOJ's support for buying stock prices only encourages
	monopoly and oligopoly. The S&amp;P 500 in the United States
	appears to be growing steadily, but its constituents are
	frequently swapped. It happens much more often than the Nikkei
	average. I don't know if Buffett is aware of this, but I don't
	think Masayoshi Son is aware of it. The industrial structure
	changes with the times. It is useless to forcibly extend the
	life of a company. The mud boat is sinking, so you can change
	boats quickly. Few investors have experienced the Great
	Depression, so it's dangerous to follow optimists.

	Heizo Takenaka may be excellent. However, he made two missteps
	during his tenure as Minister. The first is to increase
	non-regular employment and increase the number of people with
	unstable lives under the slogan of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mobilization of
	employment.</span>”</span> Second, the Industrial Revitalization
	Corporation of Japan has saved a number of large
	corporations. The government should not have saved them
	against market principles, even if they were big banks. What
	we needed was not <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mobilization of employment</span>”</span>
	but <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">natural selection of companies</span>”</span> and
	fostering new industries. Especially in the fields of software
	and the Internet, Japan has made a big gap in the United
	States. In Japan, it takes too much time to set up a
	company. Financing is not easy either. Most of all, many
	people don't know what programming is like. The more
	incompetent, the more foolish people want to be. They
	don't know, don't look up, don't ask, and
	don't even try to know. They will soon be left out of the
	world.
